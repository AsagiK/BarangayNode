Looking back, DLSU\u2019s College of Computer Studies was established back in 1981 as a center for planning, information, and computer science, offering only a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. Eventually, the College of Computer Studies department was formally declared as a college in 1984 and since its formal declaration, the college has evolved through its increased number of undergraduate programs and specializations, various master\u2019s degree programs, and more. The vision and mission of the college is to be committed to sharing knowledge in the fields of information and communications technology, and computer science to those who wish to learn.  Since these ready-to-learn individuals are what the country considers a benchmark for quality education and research, it can be considered valid that college can provide more than just what they need for their future careers. Since the mission of a college is to train students to become leaders in different domains such as technicality and entrepreneurship, this will give the students the ability to adapt to rapid changes in the environment they are in and also to the technologies they are presented with.   The College of Computer Studies is composed of three academic departments: Information Technology Department, Software Technology Department, and Computer Technology Department. As of the moment, there are five undergraduate programs that the college offers. Namely, these degree programs are BS Major in Computer Science Major in Computer Systems Engineering, BS in Computer Science with Specialization in Network Engineering, BS in Computer Science with Specialization in Software Technology, BS in Information Systems, and BS in Information Technology. As noted by this college\u2019s long history, it is continuously growing and committed to its objective of sharing expertise and knowledge through the various ways of teaching and engaging its students towards Computer Science related activities such as research forums, technology pitches, and product development.<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><!--\/center--><table valign='baseline' style='width: 98%;'><th style='width: 80px'>ICD Code<\/th><th>Description<\/th><th style='width: 170px'>Comment<\/th><tr><td>A010<\/td><td>Typhoid fever<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A0100<\/td><td>Typhoid fever; unspecified<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A014<\/td><td>Paratyphoid fever; unspecified<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A02<\/td><td>Other salmonella infections<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A020<\/td><td>Salmonella enteritis<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A022<\/td><td>Localized salmonella infections<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br>"},{"author":"Bondoc, I","patient":"114634","id":"5","date":"May 09, 2019 (10:06:16)","comment":"<center><table style='width: 85%;'><tr><th style='width:120px'>Comment<\/th><td style='text-align: left'><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspasdasda<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><!--\/center--><table valign='baseline' style='width: 98%;'><th style='width: 80px'>ICD Code<\/th><th>Description<\/th><th style='width: 170px'>Comment<\/th><tr><td>A000<\/td><td>Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01; biovar cholerae<\/td><td>asdada<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A001<\/td><td>Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01; biovar eltor<\/td><td>asdasdasdasd<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br>"},{"author":"Bondoc, I","patient":"114634","id":"8","date":"May 30, 2019 (14:22:26) (Edited: May 30, 2019 14:22:25)","comment":"<center><table style='width: 85%;'><tr><th style='width:120px'>Comment<\/th><td style='text-align: left'><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptest<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><!--\/center--><table valign='baseline' style='width: 98%;'><th style='width: 80px'>ICD Code<\/th><th>Description<\/th><th style='width: 170px'>Comment<\/th><tr><td>A00<\/td><td>Cholera<\/td><td>test<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br>"},{"author":"Please, I","patient":"114634","id":"6","date":"May 09, 2019 (11:37:01)","comment":"<center><table style='width: 85%;'><tr><th style='width:120px'>Comment<\/th><td style='text-align: left'><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptesting<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><!--\/center--><table valign='baseline' style='width: 98%;'><th style='width: 80px'>ICD Code<\/th><th>Description<\/th><th style='width: 170px'>Comment<\/th><tr><td>A00<\/td><td>Cholera<\/td><td>test<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A000<\/td><td>Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01; biovar cholerae<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr>"}]}
